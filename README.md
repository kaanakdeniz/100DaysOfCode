### Day 3 - Working with APIs in NodeJS - *03/04/2020*
I worked on some APIs in NodeJS, used request, request-promise packages for send request, locus package for debugging javascript code. I tried sending a request first then try JSON Placeholder [API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and at last made a simple movie search application by using OMDb [API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

### Day 4 - SerenityCamp - *04/04/2020*

#### Note about project!
This project is about camping grounds all around the world. I am learning web development on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) from [Colt Steele](https://github.com/Colt) and doing this project with this course. This project will take a few days and i am using HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap4 on front-end side, NodeJS/ExpressJS back-end side for now. 

This day i started to project, created pages; camping ground showpage, camping ground add page, created routes; to get this pages and post function for adding new camping grounds. Some styling improvements with Bootstrap.

### Day 5 - MongoDB/Mongoose - *05/04/2020*
I installed mongoDB and learned how to use mongo shell. After that i installed mongoose package with npm and learned how to connect to mongoDB database on JS, did some exercises on CRUD transactions.

### Day 6 - SerenityCamp v2 - *06/04/2020*
In first version of the project we was keeping of campground datas in the static array in js code. After the learning of mongoDB and Mongoose i switched the location of data. I'm using database now. After that i had to change the get and post functions to integrate database to my code. Finally i can create my campgrounds on the site and send into database and get the campground datas from database for showing in the pages.

This project is basic blog app which can perform CRUD transactions with MongoDB and it uses [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) pattern. I learned how to override POST funtion to PUT or DELETE or something in expressJS with method-overried package, I learned another CSS framework [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and used in project. I did mongoDB works with moongoose package.

### Day 8 - Data Associations - *08/04/2020*
This little project is about how to represent [one-to-many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)) relationships like user and post in ExpressJS and mongoDB with [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) package.

### Day 9 - Serenity Camp v3 - *09/04/2020*
In this version I made a module named seedDB.js for loading default random data to database. I carried my user model to models directory and i will create another file for any model in this directory later. I separate views directory to different subdirectories like comments and users to differenciate same named pages like new etc. Then refactor the old code for new requirements.
