I worked on some APIs in NodeJS, used request, request-promise packages for send request, locus package for debugging javascript code.

### Day 6 - SerenityCamp v2 - *06/04/2020*
In first version of the project we was keeping of campground datas in the static array in js code. After the learning of mongoDB and Mongoose i switched the location of data. I'm using database now. After that i had to change the get and post functions to integrate database to my code. Finally i can create my campgrounds on the site and send into database and get the campground datas from database for showing in the pages.
