# 100DaysOfCode Challenge
## Code at least one hour a day, share repos, and repeat the next day for 100 days.

### Day 1
  I've started to learn NodeJS and ExpressJS. I made my first EJS application and I did some routing exercises.

   I've learned some next level EJS like views, partials, include and assests. I created post requests and tested them.
